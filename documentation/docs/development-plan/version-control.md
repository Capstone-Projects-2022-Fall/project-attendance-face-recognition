# Version Control

*	GitHub will be used as the version control system for Attendance Face Recognition 
*	Branch protection will be utilized to prevent direct pushes to the main branch (at least one reviews required). This ensures that the main branch always remains a safe, reliable, and deployable codebase
*	Each task/feature will have its own branch for a group member to work on. A consistent naming scheme utilizing Jiraâ€™s Issue Tags will be implemented to facilitate tracking
*	Branches will be kept up-to-date and merged regularly with the staging branch to minimize the occurrence of merge conflicts
*	Thorough code reviews will be done to verify any changes. Changes themselves should be well-described in commit messages
