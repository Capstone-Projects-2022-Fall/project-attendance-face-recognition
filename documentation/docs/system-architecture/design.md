**Purpose**

The Design Document - Part I Architecture describes the software architecture and how the requirements are mapped into the design. This document will be a combination of diagrams and text that describes what the diagrams are showing.

**Requirements**

The Design Document - Part I Architecture will contain:

A description the different components and their interfaces. For example: client, server, database.

For each component provide class diagrams showing the classes to be developed (or used) and their relationship.

Describe algorithms employed in your project, e.g. neural network paradigm, training and training data set, etc.

A check list for architecture design is attached here [architecture\_design\_checklist.pdf](https://templeu.instructure.com/courses/106563/files/16928870/download?wrap=1 "architecture_design_checklist.pdf")Â  and should be used as a guidance.
