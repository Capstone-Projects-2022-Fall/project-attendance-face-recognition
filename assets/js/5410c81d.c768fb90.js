Each of us also realized that we have to gain knowledge on using different libraries of python and opencv to get familiar with face recognition using deep learning on the back end. We also decided to use MySQL to store the images of students, so the application will use it to match and identify who is present during attendence. We also decided to use Django framework and react JS to develop the front end.

If a student does not get recognized, the system will give them multiple tries. If all of them fail, they can report the issue to the professor with a button.
