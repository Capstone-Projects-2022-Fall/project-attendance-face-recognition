We also decided to use MySQL to store the images of students, so the application can use it to match and identify who is present during attendence.

A new student to the university would have to upload or capture 5 photos of themself with good lighting just one time in order to get them into the database. These photos will then be used by the application to be matched against when analyzing a student's face when they take attendance. If a student does not get recognized, the system will give them 5 tries. If all of them fail, a report issue button will pop up and they can then report their issue to the professor. On the professor's end, they will be able to see all of the reported issues and decide whether or not to reject or approve them.
