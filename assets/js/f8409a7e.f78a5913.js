This tool will make taking attendance more accurate and efficient, and will not allow the ability for users to cheat the system. As online classes and jobs become more common, the need for a web-based attendance tracker becomes more evident. Thus, we decided to create our project - AFR.\nThere are many other similar products, such as ",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://ubsapp.com/face-recognition-attendance-management/"},"https://ubsapp.com/face-recognition-attendance-management/")," and ",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://enalytix.com/face-recognition-attendance-system"},"https://enalytix.com/face-recognition-attendance-system"),", that exist in the market. However, we hope to differentiate ourselves by adding a reporting system, automatic grading, and the providing the ability to set a schedule. This way, there is little need for human work. There are also other ways to take attendance that exist already, such as manually recording and using numeric code-based attendance, however these come with more human-work and can potentially be 'cheated'. We hope to reduce the time it takes for attendance to be tracked and stored, while also allowing it to be fair for everyone.\nCitations:"),(0,r.kt)("ul",null,(0,r.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"Face recognition attendance management system: UBS.
